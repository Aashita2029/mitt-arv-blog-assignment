- JWT for authentication
- Middleware for request validation

## üöÄ How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Firebase account and configuration

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file with your Firebase configuration:

   ```
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key
   FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-client-email
   ```
4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The backend server will run on port 5000.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file with your Firebase configuration:

   ```
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
   ```
4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
